# Mars Rover

I have completed parts 1 and 2 but I didn't have time to compute the sequence of
commands required to execute the shortest path. I am computing the shortest path
so it's fairly straightforward to reconstruct the commands from that - it's just
a matter of working out when we need to turn clockwise/anti-clockwise.
